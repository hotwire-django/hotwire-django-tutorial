# Introduction

## What is Hotwire

Hotwire (HTML OVER THE WIRE) is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.

1. It is built by Basecamp (it powers the HEY email service).
1. It has a healthy ecosystem, and there are many relevant projects, tutorials about it.
1. It has become the default frontend solution in Rails.
1. It is also very popular in the PHP community (Laravel, Symfony).

## Objectives

This **open source** eBook is to help developers to quickly learn basic concepts of Hotwire, while making it work with Django.

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

1. Learn Hotwire includes `Turbo` and `Stimulus`, and what problem they can help solve.
1. Jump start frontend project bundled by Webpack.
1. Setup Turbo and Stimulus.

With Hotwire, we can bring `SPA-like experience` to our Django web app:

1. We do NOT need heavy frontend solution such as React, Vue, which requires giving over control of the DOM to their framework
2. We do NOT need JSON and Django REST framework
3. We will stick with Django form, Django templates.
